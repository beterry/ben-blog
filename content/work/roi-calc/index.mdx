## About this project

Mail Shark is an industry leading direct mail and marketing company. The sales team at Mail Shark often uses return on investment calculations to explain why direct mail is a great marketing tool. This calculation not only takes into account the customer’s average sale and mailing quantity, but also an earned customer’s retention rate and referrals. This extra calculation is effective at convincing customers to enroll in a mailing campaign.

Previously, this ROI calculation was done behind the scenes with a private spreadsheet, providing very little transparency to customers. In an effort to make this sales tool more accessible, I was tasked to create an online version of the ROI calculator targeted towards automotive shop owners.
