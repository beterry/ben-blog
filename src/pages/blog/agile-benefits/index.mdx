At Mail Shark, I’m constantly looking for ways to improve my personal workflow and the workflow of my whole department. Recently, through a conversation with a peer, I was introduced to the concept of Agile software development and how the guiding principles can be applied to many different industries and teams to make better products. 

In this blog, I’ll explain some of my research findings, how Mail Shark could benefit, and how I could implement some Agile practices to build better projects.

## What is Agile?
The term Agile is most commonly used in the software industry. It describes an iterative approach to software development. An Agile development team continually designs, develops, tests, and deploys small features over time.

To contrast, the opposite of the Agile approach is called Waterfall. Using a Waterfall approach, teams complete all the planning, testing, and coding in sequential order, one after the other, delivering a completely finished product at the end of development.

## What’s the benefit of Agile?

Software development teams that conduct this iterative approach are considered “agile” because they can easily and quickly adapt to user or stakeholder feedback. An Agile software lifecycle looks something like this:

- Release a minimum viable product (the absolute barebones necessities)
- Collect feedback and plan for the next feature
- Build the new feature
- Release the new feature
- Collect feedback and plan for the next feature
- Build the new feature
- Release the new feature
- ...and so on

If negative feedback exists after a feature is released, an Agile development team can easily address the issue or pivot completely. Being so adaptive to user feedback results in a better overall product. 

In a Waterfall environment, all the planning must be done upfront. This planning includes anticipating what the user wants in the final release. If, after an extensive development period, the user feedback is negative, it’s unfortunately difficult to adapt quickly because the software must revert to the planning stage.

This benefit of being able to quickly adapt to user needs is why the Agile methodology is so popular in the competitive software industry.

## Agile UI/UX design

An Agile project management approach can be effective in a variety of industries and teams. I believe my position as UI/UX Designer at Mail Shark would greatly benefit from adopting a more Agile workflow.

Currently, I use a Waterfall process to complete my projects. I plan, wireframe, design, and prototype in sequential order, often with a lot of back-stepping because of revisions. Many designs (like the <LinkIn to="/work/roi-calc">ROI Calculator</LinkIn>) take several weeks to months to fully complete. 

An Agile workflow would allow me to better satisfy user needs. In an Agile UI/UX process, I could first design a purposefully simplistic interface, monitor user behavior, and adapt the design to user feedback over time. After the same amount of development time as the Waterfall process, I could design the same amount of features, however, the interface could be more tailored to the user’s feedback. This process, I believe, would result in a better product.

An Agile UI/UX workflow could create more leads for the sales team at Mail Shark. An Agile process puts the product in front of customers sooner. A simple, evolving interface has a much greater chance to create a customer than no interface at all. 

## How to be Agile

There are many different practices I could adopt into my workflow at Mail Shark to become more Agile. 

### Design sprints

Sprints are iterative goals which take 1-2 weeks to complete. If a goal would take longer, it should be broken up into multiple sprints. At the end of each sprint, the project should be improved and usable.

At Mail Shark, designing a new web page could be broken into a week-long sprint like this:

- Monday - Understand what the reader should know after viewing the webpage and write the content
- Tuesday - Wireframe layout options
- Wednesday - Decide what wireframe option to use and start to collect assets
- Thursday - Prototype the design
- Friday - Share with the team and send it to the developer

It’s important that sprints do not take longer than the specified timeframe! It’s important to remember that this is an iterative process. After a sprint, the web page does not need to be 100% complete, only in working order. If the webpage is not performing well, needs more features, or revisions are necessary, they can be completed in the next design sprint. 

These short design sprints are essential to an Agile workflow.

### Sprint Planning

This meeting is completed at the beginning of a design sprint. During sprint planning, the entire team discusses what should be completed in the next design sprint (1-2 weeks). Because projects are often not 100% complete after a sprint, it’s important to be explicit about what constitutes a completed sprint (sometimes called the “definition of done”). 

Sprint planning at Mail Shark could be completed on Monday mornings. I believe these meetings would help me stay focused during sprints, better plan for explicit goals, and ensure that the team and I are communicating and collaborating.  

### Sprint Retrospective

The last practice which could make Mail Shark more Agile is the Sprint Retrospective. 

This meeting is completed at the end of a design sprint. In a Sprint Retrospective, the team inspects the past sprint and plans for improvements. These are some of the questions asked in a retro:

- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- What improvements will we commit to doing in the next Sprint?

Sprint Retrospectives could make Mail Shark more Agile by making sprints more effective and enjoyable. For me, it’s very important to always be growing and learning as a professional UI/UX Designer and Front-end Developer. Retrospectives could allow me to easily introduce and implement newly learned concepts and technology into future sprints. 

## Final thoughts

Although the Agile workflow is most commonly used in the software industry, I believe the concept of iterative product design could help me produce better user interfaces at Mail Shark. By implementing design sprints, sprint planning, and sprint retrospectives into Mail Shark’s workflow, I could better tailor my designs to user feedback and produce more leads for the sales team. 

In the future, I plan to bring these ideas to my Creative Director’s attention. I look forward to implementing some of these practices into my workflow!
