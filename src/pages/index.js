            <p>My career, after university, began as a Graphic Designer. At both Lasting Image and Sign Medix, I was the only creative professional on staff and was responsible for designing marketing materials, creating and maintaining brand guidelines, communicating with clients, updating website content, and much more.</p>
            <p>In 2017, I began experimenting with web technologies. I created my first personal website with vanilla HTML and CSS and realized front-end development was the perfect combination of my interest in design and technology. Soon after this realization, I enrolled in several online curriculums to foster my desire to become a front-end developer.</p>
            <p>In 2018, I began working at Mail Shark. Working with the Creative Director, I introduced the marketing team to Adobe XD, which allowed for a more efficient approach to designing and prototyping digital content. I created a design system that established a cohesive look for their web pages, and developed a step-by-step, goal-oriented process for completing projects. In 2019, I was promoted to User Interface and Experience Designer. Although, as UI/UX Designer, I was not responsible for developing the interfaces I created at Mail Shark, I coded my projects independently as practice.</p>
            <p>Currently, Iâ€™m working hard to learn and perfect my coding abilities to earn my first position as a front-end developer.</p>
